                Physics principles applied:

                - Conservation of Momentum: The total momentum of the system before and after
                  the collision remains constant. Given two objects with masses m1 and m2
                  and velocities v1 and v2, their momentum is conserved:
                  m1 * v1 + m2 * v2 = m1 * v1' + m2 * v2'

                - Conservation of Kinetic Energy (Elastic Collision): In a perfectly elastic
                  collision, kinetic energy is conserved:
                  0.5 * m1 * v1^2 + 0.5 * m2 * v2^2 = 0.5 * m1 * v1'^2 + 0.5 * m2 * v2'^2

                - Normal and Tangent Decomposition: Velocities are projected onto the normal
                  (collision direction) and tangent (perpendicular to normal) components.
                  - The normal component is updated using momentum conservation.
                  - The tangent component remains unchanged (assuming no friction).

                - Unit Normal and Tangent Vectors: The normal vector defines the axis along
                  which momentum exchange occurs, while the tangent vector remains unaffected.

                - Collision Response: New normal velocities are computed using the
                  1D elastic collision formula to maintain both momentum and kinetic energy.

                - Object Separation: To prevent objects from sticking together,
                  they are moved apart based on their masses and calculated overlap.
                */
